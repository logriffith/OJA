# Revature Online Certification (ROC) Program

This is a full-time training program offered by Revature. The curriculum for the program is primarily Java 8 and PostgreSQL. However, servlets and REST were also discussed during the course. 

The course concluded with a final project. It was a console-based banking application. The application used Java 8, PostgresSQL, and a main method that was essentially a giant switch statement. The code for this banking application can be found in the project folder.
