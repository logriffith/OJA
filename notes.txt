*Inheritance*

-Child class inherits properties and methods of parent class, unless they are private in parent class
-format: ChildClassName extends ParentClassName
-Java doesn't support Multiple Inheritance in classes
-Hybrid Inheritance is a combination of Hierarchical Inheritance and Multiple Inheritance.
-Thus, Java doesn't support Hybrid Inheritance in classes either
-bottom to top approach: parents methods are loaded into object, then child methods and overridden methods of parent are loaded (ex: Dog object is an instance of a Animal class through inheritance)
-super keyword is used to point to parent class objects
-super keyword is needed to point to a particular constructor in a parent class (constructor chaining) -- ex. super(id, name)
-Object class is the super class of all classes (parent of all classes)
-instance of a child class inherits methods of Object class such as getClass() and hashCode()
-hashCode() method generates (through JVM) a unique code for each object
-getClass() returns the class that an object is instance of
-both hashCode() and getClass() are non-static methods and require an object
