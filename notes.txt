*Inheritance*

-Child class inherits properties and methods of parent class, unless they are private in parent class
-format: ChildClassName extends ParentClassName
-Java doesn't support Multiple Inheritance in classes
-Hybrid Inheritance is a combination of Hierarchical Inheritance and Multiple Inheritance.
-Thus, Java doesn't support Hybrid Inheritance in classes either
-bottom to top approach: parents methods are loaded into object, then child methods and overridden methods of parent are loaded (ex: Dog object is an instance of a Animal class through inheritance)
-super keyword is used to point to parent class objects
